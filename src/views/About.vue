          The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
          athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment
          in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
          between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside
          neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small full-time staff, and relies on
          the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.
